# Committees


Arctos Committees are groups of people working towards specific goals.


## Status of this Document

This is DLM's half-baked list of things that are neat by way of https://github.com/ArctosDB/internal/issues/356. Someone please adopt this and make it better!


## Organization

The following items have been helpful.

* Meeting time choice (eg when2meet) should explicitly state whether the time applies to a single or recurring meeting.
* Meetings should be added to the Arctos calendar. Meetings which will not take place should be removed. 
* An agenda should exist, and should contain
	* The schedule
	* The zoom link
	* The overall goals of the Committee
	* Topics of discussion for the next meeting
* The agenda should be updates as early as possible to facilitate planning
* An indication of who will participate in any upcoming meetings would be very helpful (possibly google calendar function?)


## Google Calendar

* (How does one get access to the Arctos Calendar?)
* Meeting agendas should be added to the calendar invite (in whatever way magicks the nifty google docs thing)
* Zoom link should be inclided, but ***not*** in the 'location' slot (which does weird things with maps)
* The zoom link should be added in whatever way results in a link, not whatever results in the long list of numbers
