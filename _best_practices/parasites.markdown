# Best Practice - Cataloging Parasite Material

Parasite data can be challenging, but it can also be very rewarding to work with in Arctos. This Best Practice documents some of the common issues confronted when entering parasite data in Arctos and offers solutions developed by the collections who have already addressed them. As always, if a solution appears less-than-optimal, [file an issue](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/new/choose) and help make Arctos better for everyone!

For the purposes of this guide, a parasite is any preserved remains, observation, or trace of an organism that has sustained contact with another organism (the host) to the detriment of the host organism. Examples include single-celled protozoans such as the agents of malaria, sleeping sickness, and amoebic dysentery; animals such as hookworms, lice, mosquitoes, and vampire bats; fungi such as honey fungus and the agents of ringworm; and plants such as mistletoe, dodder, and the broomrapes.

## Describing the Host Organism

### Best Option - Link to an Arctos Catalog Record

The most powerful method for describing the host organism of a cataloged parasite is to create an Arctos catalog record for the host. This allows a complete description of both the parasite and host identification and classification. It also provides the means to more completely describe both organisms including appropriate attributes and if applicable, the location of any preserved material.
