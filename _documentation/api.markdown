# Arctos API

**Note: this documentation refers to the 2021 API (since Jan 2021).**
A REST-style API existed in 2020 ([old documentation][1]).  The
original JSON/CSV API (of the form
`https://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenResultsJSON.cfm?accn_number=...`)
is no longer functional.

## Request format

 * **Endpoint**: <https://arctos.database.museum/component/api/v1/>.
   Accepts both HTTP GET and POST. Use POST for long query strings
 * **API key**: most API requests must be accompanied by the key-value
   pair `api_key=...` in the query string. To obtain a key:
     * Ask anyone with Arctos `global_admin` access. They should look
       under the menus: ‘Manage Arctos -> Developer Tools -> Manage
       API Keys’
     * Or file a request as an Issue at
       <https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues>
 * **Services** (append these to the endpoint URL above):
    * `about.cfc?method=api_map`: Basic info about the API (no API key required)
    * `catalog.cfc?method=about`: **API usage documentation** and list of 
       variables for catalog queries, and fields for requesting in results (no
       API key required)
    * `authority.cfc?method=code_tables`: List code tables. With parameter 
      `tbl=...` request contents of a code table (_requires API key_)
    * `catalog.cfc?method=getCatalogData`: **Main specimen search**
      (_requires API key_)

## Specimen query terms

 * The API uses the same underlying code that `SpecimenResults.cfm` uses, so
   documentation for a search field can be found by clicking on the
   field name in the standard Arctos Specimen form.
 * Search terms are added as key-value pairs using the terms listed in
   `catalog.cfc?method=about`. When two or more search terms are used
   a logical ‘AND’ is assumed.
 * Sets of specimens can be requested via a comma-delimited list of
   GUIDs.

## Results

 * Only JSON results are currently available.  
 * The default fields returned for a specimen search are: `guid`,
   `scientific_name`, `country`, `state_prov`, `spec_locality`,
   `verbatim_date`, `dec_lat`, `dec_long`,
   `coordinateuncertaintyinmeters`. To add additional fields use the
   `cols=...` key-value pair, with field names separated by commas.
 * By default, a maximum of 10 records are returned. Sending
   `pgsz=...` can be used to ask for more records (tested up to
   20,000). If a page size limit is reached, the results will need to
   be collected via multiple calls to the API, paging with the
   `pg=...` variable until `"TotalRecordCount":"..."` (in the JSON) is
   reached. Note that in the original query, a `"tbl":"..."` value is
   returned - this is an identifier for the temporary results
   set. During pagination, calling `tbl=...&pgsz=...&pg=...` will be
   faster than requesting paginated results via original query
   parameters.

## Examples: 

```
Single specimen by GUID, with additional columns:

  https://arctos.database.museum/component/api/v1/catalog.cfc?method=getCatalogData&api_key=...&guid=UAM:Herb:34746&cols=partdetail,phylum

Several specimens by GUID:

  https://arctos.database.museum/component/api/v1/catalog.cfc?method=getCatalogData&api_key=...&guid=UAM:Herb:34746,UAM:Herb:34745

Specimens by name:

  https://arctos.database.museum/component/api/v1/catalog.cfc?method=getCatalogData&api_key=...&genus=Claytonia&species=arctica
```
