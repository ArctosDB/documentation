# Beyond Arctos

Data in Arctos is publicly searchable and can be downloaded, but the data can also be re-published to data aggregators such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), iDigBio, and VertNet. The benefit of re-publishing is that the data can reach a broader audience. In general, publishing to any of the aggregators is accomplished via addition of a dataset to the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT). For some aggregators such as Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and various Symbiota Portals, extra steps are involved.
