# Cache

Data are flattened and cached in two wide spreadsheet-like tables, FLAT and FILTERED_FLAT. The latter is the former stripped of encumbered, private, internal, and sensitive data.

## Structure


<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15w_JYNP1w4XeIB6tAZHIxXeA5ea8Ue9BYTVKfQggVUs/edit?gid=0#gid=0>  is a work in progress; file an Issue for assistance.


## Status

Check flat cache in the directory. (FLAT is less than one minute stale ~99+% of the time, but may occasionally be days or weeks out of date.)
