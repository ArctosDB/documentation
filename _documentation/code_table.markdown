Many values are controlled by authorities which we call code tables.

## Principles

All code table values should adhere to our principles [developing document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/106K73W3og-iFLI9TZlfK00GtvVOJjIx5rU_43TsP49E/edit#slide=id.g24c167402f2_0_0)) in support of standardized, normalized, properly-categorized, connected, sharable "Research Grade" data.

### Reality

Arctos is a Community, and often cleaning up "legacy" data in favor of ideals is a difficult process involving local processes across hundreds of collections. We remain convinced that Arctos data are more capable of supporting deep research than anything else in existence, but we also acknowledge the realities of humans, traditions, resources, funding, etc.



## Collection-Specific Values


Many code tables are collection-specific. Operators with ``manage_collection`'' roles may select individual values for use in their collections under manage collection, or at the top of the relevant code table page. For example, parts:
