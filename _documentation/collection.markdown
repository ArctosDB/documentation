# Collection

An Arctos collection is a group of co-managed records. Most collections are "traditional," (eg MVZ Mammal Collection, [https://arctos.database.museum/collection/MVZ:Mamm](https://arctos.database.museum/collection/MVZ:Mamm)) but there are few  technical constraints.

## collection_id

Internal primary key (integer), not to be confused with collectionID generated from guid_prefix.

## guid_prefix

The "functional primary key" which most usefully defines a collection in Arctos. Used as part of the catalog record identifier which each record in Arctos recieves. Forms collectionID when prefixed by ``https://arctos.database.museum/collection/``. Note that this is a concept with no dependencies; it is completely unrelated to ``institution_acronym``, ``collection_cde``, and all other fields in all other tables.

## citation

Recommended text for citing the collection. Cataloged items within a collection should be cited by GUID.

## catalog_number_format

Foreign key to [https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcatalog_number_format](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcatalog_number_format)

## genbank_collection

Collection identifier as registered with NCBI. Used to automatcally find records in GenBank.

## loan_policy_url

A loan policy is required by Arctos, but the contents of the policy are left to the collection. 

## web_link and web_link_text

Used to make links to the collection's web page from the Arctos UI.

## collection

Free text short description

## institution_acronym

Legacy column, used to group collections in UI and serves as a VPD partition for managing containers


## institution

Free-text

## collection_cde

Legacy column, can be useful for selecting 'suggested' authority items.

## internal_license_id

Foreign key to [https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctdata_license](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctdata_license), licenses data downloaded from Arctos.


## external_license_id

Foreign key to [https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctdata_license](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctdata_license), licenses data downloaded from outside Arctos (eg, DWC Portals). Data from these sources are generally incomplete, are often outdated, and should be used with caution.


## collection_terms_id

Foreign key to [https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollection_terms](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollection_terms), a terms document is intended to suppliement licenses.

## default_cat_item_type

Allows a collection to specify a default value for [https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcataloged_item_type](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcataloged_item_type) in records.


## preferred_identifiers 

Prioritize certain identifiers in UI using [https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcoll_other_id_type](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcoll_other_id_type).

## preferred_identifier_issuers 

Prioritize certain identifiers in UI using Issued By Agent.

## collection_agent_id

Foreign key to Agents. All collections have a coresponding Agent, which provides data structure for additional information.
