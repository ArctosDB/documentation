# Locality Attributes

Locality Attributes in Arctos are used to add descriptive terms to a [Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/locality.html). These terms are controlled by the vocabulary contained in the [ctlocality_attribute_type](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlocality_attribute_type) code table. For a summary of geologic stratigraphy, see the <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/images/7/7f/255-271_Murphy_.pdf">International Stratigraphic Guide â€”An abridged version</a>

The terms applied using Locality Attributes can generally be summarized in the following groups [Stratigraphic Information](#stratigraphi-information), [Petrology](#petrology), [Biochronology](#biochronology), [Public Land Survey System](#public-land-survey-system), [landholder](#site-land-status), and a [locality encumbrance](#locality-encumbrance) attribute for localities that need to be excluded from public view. 

## Stratigraphic Information

Geologic strata may be classified according to many different properties. Each classification has its own distinctive nomenclature and some also include a hierarchical structure. The following kinds of strata are currently represented in Arctos: 

### Biostratigraphy 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostratigraphy">Biostratigraphy</a> is the branch of geologic stratigraphy in which strata are based on the fossil content of the rock bodies.  Biostrata can be added to localities using the biostratigraphic zone locality attribute. Biostratigraphic zone values are controlled by the [ctbiostratigraphic_zone](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctbiostratigraphic_zone) code table. 

### Chronostratigraphy 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronostratigraphy">Chronostratigraphy</a> is the branch of geologic stratigraphy in which units are based on the time of formation of the rock bodies. [International Commission on Stratigraphy](https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/) chronostrata can be added to localities using the following locality attributes: 

 - Eon/Eonothem - chronostratigraphic units in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart [https://stratigraphy.org/chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart). Eon/Eonothem values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_eon_eonothem](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_eon_eonothem) code table.
 - Era/Erathem - chronostratigraphic units in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart [https://stratigraphy.org/chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart) Era/Erathem values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_era_erathem](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_era_erathem) code table.
 - System/Period - chronostratigraphic units in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart [https://stratigraphy.org/chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart). System/Period values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_system_period](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_system_period) code table.
 - Series/Epoch - chronostratigraphic units in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart [https://stratigraphy.org/chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart). Series/Epoch values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_series_epoch](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_series_epoch) code table.
 - Stage/Age - chronostratigraphic units in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart [https://stratigraphy.org/chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart).
 Stage/Age values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_stage_age](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_stage_age) code table. 
 - Substage/Subage - chronostratigraphic units in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart [https://stratigraphy.org/chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart). Substage/Subage values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_substage_subage](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_substage_subage) code table. 

Informal chronostrata can be added to localities using the informal chronostratigraphy attribute. Informal chronostratigraphy are published chronostratigraphic units that are not in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, for example, regional chronostratigraphies. Informal chronostratigraphy values are controlled by the [ctchronostrat_informal](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctchronostrat_informal) code table. 

### Lithostratigraphy 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithostratigraphy">Lithostratigraphy</a> is the branch of geologic stratigraphy in which units are based on the lithologic properties of the rock. Lihtostrata can be added to localities using the following locality attributes: 

 - lithodemic suite - a unit of lithodemic stratigraphy (describes bodies of rock which do not conform to the law of superposition). Lithodemic suite values are controlled by the [ctlithodemic_suite](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlithodemic_suite) code table.
 - lithostratigraphic group - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(stratigraphy)). Lithostratigraphic group values are controlled by the [ctlithostratigraphic_group](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlithostratigraphic_group) code table.
 - lithostratigraphic formation - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_formation). Lithostratigraphic formation values are controlled by the [ctlithostratigraphic_formation](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlithostratigraphic_formation) code table.
 - lithostratigraphic member -  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphic_unit#Member). Lithostratigraphic member values are controlled by the [ctlithostratigraphic_member](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlithostratigraphic_member) code table.
 - lithostratigraphic bed - a named lithostratigraphic bed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_(geology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_(geology)). Lithostratigraphic bed values are controlled by the [ctlithostratigraphic_bed](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlithostratigraphic_bed) code table.  

## Biochronology

In paleontology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochronology">biochronology</a> is the correlation in time of biological events using fossils. In its strict sense, it refers to the use of assemblages of fossils that are not tied to stratigraphic sections (in contrast to biostratigraphy, where they are). The basic unit of biochronology is the biochron, a collection of fossils found together in a rock unit. The following biochron groups are available in Arctos:

 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochronology#Land_mammal_ages">Land Mammal Ages</a> - A chronology based on mammal taxa has been defined on all the continents except Antarctica. Most of the units are based on assemblage zones, layers of strata that contain three or more distinctive fossils.
 
 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochronology#Land-vertebrate_ages">Land Vertebrate Faunachrons</a> - Land-vertebrate "ages" (LVAs) or faunachrons have been proposed that use other vertebrates such as dinosaurs. 

## Public Land Survey System

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System">Public Land Survey System</a> (PLSS) is the surveying method developed and used in the United States to plat, or divide, real property for sale and settling. Public Land Survey System information can be added to localities using the following locality attributes:

- TRS section - An approximately one-square-mile block of land. There are 36 sections in a survey township. TRS section values are controlled by the [cttrs_section](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=cttrs_section) code table.  
- TRS township - A measure of the distance north or south from a referenced baseline, in units of six miles. TRS township values are controlled by the [cttrs_township](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=cttrs_township) code table. 
- TRS range - A measure of the distance east or west from a referenced principal meridian, in units of six miles. TRS range values are controlled by the [cttrs_range](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=cttrs_range) code table. 
- TRS aliquot - A terse, hierarchical reference to a piece of land, in which successive subdivisions of some larger area are appended to the beginning of the reference. For example, SW1/4 NW1/4 S13, T1SR20E refers to the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of section 13 of Township 1 South Range 20 East (a 40-acre parcel). TRS aliquot is a free text attribute, but it is recommended that the format shown above be followed in order to allow for more accurate search results when using the TRS aliquot attribute.

## Landholder

The landholder is the legal landowner or government land administration agency. Landholder values are controlled by the [ctlandholder](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlandholder) code table. Private property should be designated as private with the "private" landholder attribute and property ownership can be recorded in the attribute remark.

## Locality Encumbrance

When it is necessary to hide a locality from public view, use the private (access) attribute. For more on this attribute, see [Encumbering Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Encumber-Locality.html#encumbering-locality).

### Structure

[Locality Attributes](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctlocality_attribute_type) attach information to a [Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/locality.html). Each locality may contain any number of locality attributes. Each Locality Attribute may be accompanied by a determiner (an [Arctos Agent](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/agent.html)), determination date, determination method, units if required, and a remark.

### Searching

Locality attributes are asserted individually, however, chronostratigraphic terms (Eon/Eonothem, Era/Erathem, System/Period, Series/Epoch, Stage/Age, Substage/Subage) include a hierarchical structure which makes it possible to locate cataloged items attributed to strata which is more specific than the search term.

## Site Identifier

Identifiers may be local or come from external resources. When possible, supply an identifier that is persistent and globally unique.

### Mindat

<a href="https://www.mindat.org/countrylist.php">Mindat localities</a> may be represented in Arctos with the url for the Mindat location. Add the site identifier attribute to the locality, enter the Mindat url for the location in the attribute value and enter "Mindat" as the locality attribute determiner.
