# Permits

Permits are any documentation authorizing activity, linked to transactions
([Accessions](/documentation/accession), [Loans](/documentation/loans), and [Borrows](/documentation/borrow)). 
Permits may be issued by governmental agencies, landowners, registrations (e.g., CITES), etc.


A permit can authorize any number of transactions, and any number of permits may be required for a transaction.

identifier has not been provided by the issuer.

## Permit Type
