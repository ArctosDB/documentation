# Permits

Permits are any documentation authorizing activity, linked to transactions ([Accessions](/documentation/accession), [Loans](/documentation/loans), and [Borrows](/documentation/borrow)). Permits may be issued by governmental agencies, landowners, registrations (e.g., CITES), etc. Permits may carry any level of authority (including none), and apply to any (or no) context or jurisdiction. 

A permit can be linked to any number of transactions, and any number of permits may be liked from a single transaction.
