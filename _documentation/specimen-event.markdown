# Record Event

Record Events link [Records]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/catalog.html) to [Events]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/collecting-event.html).

## Event Determiner

[Agent]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/agent.html) asserting that the [Record]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/catalog.html) has [Event Type](#type) relationship to an event (including locality, geography, geology, etc.).

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**

This person has determined coordinates and error, dates, higher geography, and everything else in the "[place and time stack]({{site.baseurl}}how_to/How-to-understand-the-Arctos-Locality-Model.html)."

## Event Date

The date on which the [Event]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/collecting-event.html) was assigned to the [Record]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/catalog.html).

## Event Type

The action during the [Event]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/collecting-event.html) that affected the [Record]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/catalog.html).

Select from values in [Object Event: Types](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTSPECIMEN_EVENT_TYPE).

## Verification Status

The opinion of the verifier of the veracity and completeness of the coordinates included in the [Event]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/collecting-event.html).

Select from values in [Object Event: Verification Status Values](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTVERIFICATIONSTATUS)

## Verified By

[Agent]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/agent.html) who selected the Verification Status.

## Verified Date

Date on which Verification Status was set.

## Collecting Method

Describe methods employed at the event as they relate specifically to the record. Examples:

 - gill net
 - hand seine
 - Otter Trawl
 - salvage, roadkill, DOR

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Pro.jpg) **Pro Tip**

Method may be better placed in the [event method](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcoll_event_attr_type#event_method) event attribute if the method corresponds to all records that may have participated in the event.

## Collecting Source

A broad categorization of how the record came to be at the event.

Select from [Event: Source Values](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollecting_source).

## Habitat

Describe the habitat at the place and time of the event as it relates specifically to the record. Examples:

-   limestone outcrops and ledges with dwarf shrub, sedge herbaceous
    tundra, scattered
-   under spruce bark
-   steep west-facing slopes

## Remarks

Use only for data which pertains to the relationship between the record and the event and which is not appropriate for any more-specific fields.

# Edit Record Event Form

There are two ways to edit record events and associated place/time data.

1.  old/normal way
	* normalized, makes managing data for shared localities easy
	* normalized, makes accidentally editing unrelated specimens easy
	* requires scary access to shared data
	* requires an in-depth understanding of the Arctos Locality Model to safely use

2. Fork-Edit method
	* denormalized - every save creates a new locality and event
	    * but who cares, the cleanup scripts will renormalize the data by consolidating duplicates and purging orphans
	* requires only manage_specimens access; always creates new localities which can't possibly be shared,
	so the back-end can safely run with elevated rights to create localities, collecting events, and geology determinations
	* provides a one-click path to keeping full history as unaccepted specimen-events
		* adding rather than editing is an option on every save
		    * AWG: should *not* achiving be an option at all?
	* One-click georeferencing with GeoLocate
	* GUI georeference editing with GeoLocate
	* Provides service-derived coordinates and elevation; use them with one click


## Fork-Edit method

This creates a new locality and event with every save. There are two save modes:

* edit ("Edit the current specimen_event") should be used when changes have not affected the fundamental nature of the space-time data.
Fixing a typo in a remarks field, verifying an event, making minor georeference adjustments, etc. can safely use this approach. When
this option is used, the specimen-event is moved out of the "old" event and locality; it becomes detached from any history those objects
may have had, and if other specimens are not using the event/locality they will be purged by the cleanup scripts.

* add ("unaccept current specimen_event; add Event with these data") creates a new specimen event, and preserves the old. This maintains
the history of the specimen being attached to now-unaccepted events, and the edit history of those events and the localities to
which they are attached; it is a purely additive action. This option should be used for major or fundamental changes to the locality.

In both cases "save" clones the entire event/locality/geology stack; edits apply only to the single specimen-event being used by the single specimen.
It is not possible to alter data used by any other specimen from this form.
