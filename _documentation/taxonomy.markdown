# Taxonomy

## Overview

The taxonomic model in Arctos is designed to provide both a controlled table
to reduce errors and the flexibility to accommodate each collection’s
preferred taxonomic structure and ongoing changes in taxonomic classifications.   

"Taxonomy" for the purposes of this document and Arctos in general is
"some formal naming system." Arctos taxonomy is not necessarily
hierarchical, it is not limited to biological taxonomies, we follow no
organization or committee guidelines, and we make no distinction between
taxonomy and nomenclature. We offer no judgements or guidelines
regarding acceptability; if all or part of a system of names (and
optionally metadata regarding those names) is accepted or endorsed by
some user group, it’s acceptable for Arctos. If publication "A new
species of critter" declares, however informally, that "*Some critter*"
is a distinct "species" (in the loosest possible sense of the word),
then "Some critter" may be a useful taxon in Arctos. 

If another publication declares "*Some critterrrr*" is not a valid
taxon, biological distinction, etc., then "Some critterrrr" may still be
a useful taxon name to include in Arctos for discovery purposes, even
though it’s an obvious misspelling of a rejected name. In short, if a name
might be useful in discovering specimens, it should be included in
Arctos. Remarks, annotated taxon relationships, [taxon status](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_STATUS) and links to
publications should be used to clarify.

Arctos taxonomy consists of two tables: 
-  taxon names are the "base names" such as Animalia, Aves, *Canis lupus* or nonbiological "granite" 
-  taxon terms are classification metadata regarding a taxon name such as author, taxon status, or nomenclatural code.

Informal terms, such as "*Sorex sp.*" or "*Sorex cinereus* or *Sorex ugyunak*" are
identifications, not taxonomy. Identifications are, however, generally drawn from
and linked to taxonomy in various ways.


## Taxon Name

Taxon names are intended to be a formal taxonomic
authority and should all be drawn from relevant taxonomic publications.
A name is not linked to any particular classification (rather,
classifications are linked to taxon names) and may be a homonym or
hemihomonym. The name ["Diptera"](https://arctos.database.museum/name/Diptera) correctly includes classifications
for flies and plants, and the taxon has both an Arctos and an Arctos Plants classification.  This is not a mistake and should not be
"corrected" to any particular point of view. Another example is [Ficus gracilis](https://arctos.database.museum/name/Ficus%20gracilis) which is both a plant and an animal taxon.  Adding the author as non-classification data can ensure that the correct term is selected by users.

Taxon names may be disambiguated at the specimen level via identification publications ("ID
sensu"), and at the collection level by choosing and curating a
classification. Database rules prevent change of used names. Names may
be higher taxon terms, such as "Animalia," ICZN-type
genus-species-subspecies concatenations, ICBN-type
genus-species-infraspecific rank-infraspecific epithet concatenations,
or nonbiological taxonomy terms ("Granite"). A distinguishing
feature of this field is that a curator, usually a taxonomist, considers
the name to be formal taxonomy.

While single classifications may be hierarchical, taxonomy as a body of 
literature is anything but: Most names have a long history of "current
family, according to….", for example, and many refer to multiple
concepts, such as plants and animals.

Arctos users with taxonomic authority may create, edit and delete taxonomic names and classifications.  Complete instructions are given in the How-to Section of the Handbook.

## Name Type

Taxon Names are typed using [taxon_name_type](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=cttaxon_name_type). Name type is functional; different types of names have different rules and may be used for different purposes. Note that many homonyms exist, so this classification is somewhat arbitrary. For example, "Oar" may refer to a device used to propel a watercraft or a genus of Lepidopteran.

## Validation Service

Arctos checks taxon names against various services on creation and edit. This check is a tool, not an authority; all services have significant problems as of this writing. "Valid" names will occasionally be flagged as invalid, and erroneous names will occasionally pass.  One of the services contains data from Arctos, so the check is a bit circular. Users remain fully responsible for the content of Arctos taxonomy.  

## Taxon Term

[Taxon Term](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_TERM) contains metadata regarding taxon names and a system for organizing such data. Every term may be arranged hierarchically within a
classification, and hierarchical terms may optionally be ranked. Terms are further divided as:

-   "Local data" are curated from within Arctos and may be edited. A
    [controlled vocabulary](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_TERM)
    is required for "local" data.
-   “Webservice data” are drawn from various sources via GlobalNames.org and is used primarily for locating specimens.  The specific sources vary with the taxon a user is searching for.  These webservices are frequently cloned to create a classification for a new taxon name in a local source.

### Hierarchical Classification Terms

Terms which are organized hierarchically are "classification data"
intended to be part of a classification system. These terms may be
ranked or unranked but unranked terms may make it difficult for users to
find your specimens. Here is the classification for the mollusk *Ficus gracilis*.

### Classification Metadata

These are terms which are not part of the classification but clarify and augment the taxon classification. 
There are currently eight Metadata Term Types which may be completed.

•	**[nomenclatural_code](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTNOMENCLATURAL_CODE)** is controlled by the code table.  Most common values are “ICZN” and “ICNB.”  This is a mandatory field.  
•	**author_text** is the author of ICZN names, or the species author of ICBN names.  Always include the author (with or without parenthensis as appropriate) unless no author is given.     
•	**infraspecific_author** is the author of the infraspecific epithet in ICBN names  
•	**[taxon-status](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_STATUS)** is controlled by a code table.   
•	**source_authority** should list the publication, website or other authority for the taxon.     
•	**remark** is an open field for any comment that will be helpful to Arctos users.  
•   **aphiaid** is the taxon identification assigned by the World Register of Marine Species  
•   **preferred name** is completed for "invalid" taxa to identify the synonym that is the valid taxon name.  This is especially helpful when there are multiple synonyms listed.  

The Display Name and Scientific Name are autogenerated by Arctos.

## Common Names

Common Names are intended to help users find what they are looking
for, and not to propagate any standard or system. A taxon may have
several common names, in several languages and using several types of
characters, or nothing. The same common name may apply to more than one
taxon. For example, the term "common shrew" has been published for
*Sorex cinereus* in North America and for *Sorex araneus* in Europe.
Common names have not been capitalized except when they draw on a
particular standard such as that of the American Ornithological Union
(AOU Checklist).  Adjectival forms of proper names are capitalized
(*e.g.*, "Alaska marmot").

Common Names are added to the taxon record as classification metadata.

## Taxon Relations

[Taxon Relations](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_RELATION)
are comprised of a relationship type, a related
taxon, and an authority for the relationship. The related taxon is
another record in the taxonomy table.

__________________
    
The [taxon status](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_STATUS) is used to clarify which synonym is preferred by entering "valid" for the accepted or preferred name and "invalid" for the unaccepted name.

## Taxon Relation Authority

Taxon Relation Authority is an open text field, and it may be `null`.
Presumably the Authority for an accepted
taxon is adequate documentation, but if not, then Relationship Authority
could cite a publication or the name of an expert to whom the
relationship is attributed.

Most Taxon Relations represent synonymy among taxa. As evolutionary
relationships and nomenclature are revisited, changes in taxonomy are
suggested, and either accepted or rejected. Which changes are accepted,
and by whom, is a routine issue. Therefore, keeping track of synonomy in
the database can be important to users. If they cannot find material
they are seeking under one name, they may find the name that they are
using and its accepted synonym, or they may use a query which returns
records from unaccepted synonyms.

Any number of taxa may be synonymous, but only one should have the [Taxon Status](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_STATUS) of “valid.” The other synonyms should have the Taxon Status “invalid.”

Named hybrids have a unique relationship to their
parent taxa, and this is expressed by "hybrid offspring of." Each named
hybrid should have two such relationships.

Taxon relations may also represent hierarchical relationships between
taxa. So far, this is included only for the purpose of constructing
botanical trinomens with author text for both the species and the
infraspecific category. For example, *Trichophorum pumilum* (M. Vahl)
Schinz & Thell var.*Rollandii* (Fern.) Hult. would be constructed from
the "parent" binomen, *Trichophorum pumilum* (M. Vahl) Schinz & Thell
plus the infraspecific rank, "subspecies," and author text from the
"child" trinomen, *Trichophorum pumilum* var. *Rollandii* (Fern.) Hult.

## Publications

Taxon names may be linked to any number of Publications. These publications should
directly support the name.

## Taxon Classification Sources

There are several [local sources](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXONOMY_SOURCE) of taxonomic data that can be used by a collection for specimen identification.  Each collection selects any number of sources and specifies an order of preference; the classification(s) from the first encountered source with relevant data are used in their records for specimen identification.  Taxon names and classifications of "Local" sources are added, deleted and modified via Arctos.  A [controlled vocabulary](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTTAXON_TERM) is required for local data.  

Collections may elect to use an independent taxonomic database that suits their specimens. They remain responsible to curate the taxa.


Through GlobalNames webservice, Arctos users can access multiple remote classifications for taxa.  These are automatically maintained and cannot be edited by Arctos users.  They are provided as a resource and Arctos users frequently clone them into the local source used by the collection.  Arctos users may wish to collaborate with the remote sources to edit taxa before they are pushed to GlobalNames and then to Arctos.

### Usage of Sources

Taxonomy in general does not scale well; there are very many homonyms (intra-Code shared names; "Echidna" may refer to mammals, reptiles, fish, etc.) and hemihomonyms (cross-Code shared names; Adesmia muricata is a beetle and a legume). These are simply ignored in many taxonomy resources, but this situation is not possible in Arctos which may for example hold type material for both Echidna-the-mammal and Echidna-the-eel. We recommend taxonomy be managed at about the same scales as which it's created, and the ability of a collection to prefer multiple Sources provides a mechanism by which to do so. This approach also provides a mechanism by which taxonomists may curate only those names which are of special importance to them, and share those with other collections. For example, if:

* CollectionA has a shrew expert who manages soricid data in "Shrews by UserA"
* CollectionB has a bat expert who manages some chiropteran data in "Bats of North America (UserB)"
* CollectionC has no relevant expertise to share at all

then all three collections might prefer

1. Shrews by UserA
1. Bats of North America (UserB)
1. Arctos (a legacy ICZN-centric mess of ~1.8 million inconsistently-classified names)

and for those collections, a shrew would draw classification data from *Shrews by UserA*, a bat would draw from *Bats of North America (UserB)*, and a moose would fall back to *Arctos* for classification data.

*Shrews by UserA* might be managed in local software and periodically exported to Arctos, *Bats of North America (UserB)* might be managed in a specialized part of Arctos (eg, the hierarchical editor), and *Arctos*  is managed by many users via the Arctos single-record classification editor.

If CollectionD, who has their own shrew expert who doesn't entirely agree with UserA, comes along, they can simply manage the conflicting data (perhaps a single genus) in "Myosorex by CollectionD" using the tool of their choice, and prefer

1. Myosorex by CollectionD
1. Shrews by UserA
1. Bats of North America (UserB)
1. Arctos

which will result in a Myosorex drawing from *Myosorex by CollectionD*, a Sorex drawing from *Shrews by UserA*, a bat from *Bats of North America (UserB)*, and so on.

### Managing Sources

Arctos taxonomy may be managed in about any tool, but "saves" will ultimately need to go through one of three pathways.

1. The built-in "single record edit screen" may be used to alter any aspect of a single classification. The Arctos data model - and therefore the tool built directly upon it - are not
interested in consistency, but rather in being capable of losslessly accepting any data which might be considered "taxonomy." It is near-inevitable that edits using this tool will produce increasingly inconsistent data. This may be a valuable trait when managing particularly heterogeneous data, but is best avoided when consistency between records (_e.g._, if all _Canis_ should be children of _Canidae_) is desirable.

2. The classification bulkloader is essentially a "flat" file format, but tools which write to it need not be entirely flat. (The Arctos hierarchical tools ultimately converts to this format, for example.) Most (perhaps all) checklists or exports from tools should be capable of being munged into this format. This makes it possible to manage taxonomy in a desktop tool (including something as simple as a spreadsheet) and periodically save to a Source in Arctos, or to push products of virtually any tool to an Arctos source.

3. The hierarchical classification bulkloader is a parent-child file format, into which most hierarchical data should be transformable. The built-in hierarchical taxonomy editor can import from and export to this format, and using this format rather than the flatter CSV option in eg, spreadsheets greatly reduces the possibility of introducing inconsistencies.

##  Examples of model taxa

The taxonomic model in Arctos conveys more than just the classification of each taxon.  As displayed in the examples below, each taxon entry integrates media and the geolocation of specimens in Arctos identified with that taxon name.  This can be a highly useful tool for researchers and the general public.  Here are links to various taxa that show these features.

## Taxonomic Concepts

Despite their ubiquitous use in biology, taxonomic names on their own
can be ambiguous identifiers for communicating the taxonomic concept
intended by a taxonomist, where “taxonomic concept” refers to an
understanding of the range of variation in a taxon, and its
boundaries, i.e., a taxon’s circumscription. As taxa are revised, and
sometimes merged with or split from other taxa, the circumscription
associated with an unchanging type specimen’s name may change
greatly. In order to overcome this ambiguity, it is recommended that
the usage of a name is always specified: name X _according to_
publication Y; this is the ‘taxon concept’ of biodiversity informatics
(Franz, N., Peet, R. K., and Weakley, A. 2008. On the use of taxonomic
concepts in support of biodiversity research and taxonomy. In `The New
Taxonomy` ed. Q. D. Wheeler). 

Since 2020, the Arctos data model allows for i) associating taxon
concepts with names, ii) mapping taxon concepts to other taxon
concepts (using terms from set theory), and iii) giving a taxonomic
concept in an identification as well as just a name.

## Editors

### Built-in single-record editor

The single-record editor has limited control of data within a record, and no control of consistency across records. We do not recommend using this tool if those attributes are important.

### Built-in hierarchical editor

Arctos provides a hierarchical editor which is capable of producing consistent data. Import and export tools are built into Arctos.

### CSV

Arctos provides a full-features CSV upload option. Data may be managed in anything which will export CSV, and that CSV may be imported into Arctos.

## FAQ

**Q: Why not hierarchies/thesauri/some other model?**

A: The taxonomy model is primarily designed for flexibility, an idea
somewhat incompatible with more-structured data. This model is designed
to work with changes, uncertainty, unranked terms, and even
nonbiological taxonomies, and to communicate with services such as
globalnames.

**Q: Why does the editing interface not ….. ?**

A: The editing interfaces are designed to get us by until
[someone](http://gnite.org) does a better job, and are a reflection of
the model in being very generic (and therefore also very limited and
scary in terms of multi-record updates). We hope that most taxonomy will
eventually be managed in remote, limited-scope applications (that is,
applications that do not have to worry about historical names and
homonyms and all the other reality that is taxonomy at the scale of
Arctos) rather than in Arctos (which can now leverage any number of
those services to compile a complete picture).

**Q: How does the model assert "acceptedness"?**

A: All names exist because someone with the proper credentials loaded
them, and presumably because there exists "appropriate" (a term which
varies by discipline, tradition, and time) literature creating or
supporting them. Collections choose a classification, which asserts
"classification according to this collection."   Many classifications
are historic and no longer accepted but may be helpful in searching
for specimens.  They should be marked "invalid" and linked to the currently 
valid taxon.
