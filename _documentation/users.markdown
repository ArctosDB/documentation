# Users

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**  

Do not perform any user administration actions before reading and understanding this entire document.

## Terminology

There are three categories of “users” described here:

- Arctos users are people who have Arctos accounts. Anyone can create any number of these for any reason.
- Arctos Agents are people (and some other stuff) who do things – collectors, identifiers, data entry personnel, etc.
- Arctos Operators are people who can create or update data in Arctos. They must be both users and agents before they may become operators.


## Creating Operators

New operators must first become users. Their account name must use only letters and numbers (ASCII characters A-Z, a-z, and 0-9), and cannot begin with a number. (Public users can use any characters.) They must have an email address in their Profile. A password of at least six characters, starting with a letter, containing only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and ``!$%&()`*+,-/:;?_.``, not containing the username, and consisting of at least one letter, number, and special character will make the invitation process slightly less cryptic.
    
New operators must be agents. Under the Agents tab, locate them if they are an existing agent or, after carefully checking, create them as a new agent. The Agent will be selected and linked to the user after clicking the 'invite' button.

Operators must be agents of type "person." Group accounts or shared logins are not permitted.
    
From Management/Arctos/Arctos Users, click Invite to allow them to create an internal user account. This will send email to you and to them. They will have to ensure that their username is valid, pass certain password checks, etc. to become users.
    
After the user has completed Step 3, you will receive a notification email. You may then assign them appropriate data and collection roles. The COLDFUSION_USER role must be provided for the user to log in. DATA_ENTRY is the minimum additional role to enable data entry. Provide documentation, which can be found from the big red box on the manage users page.

## User Roles

There are two types of “roles” in Arctos: Collection roles and access roles. Collection roles provide access to VPD partitions, and access roles provide specific access to specific tables.  Actual access is at the intersection of roles. A user with UAM_MAMM collection role and DATA_ENTRY access role can only enter data for the UAM Mamm collection.

Some objects (taxonomy, media, agents, places) are shared amongst collections. People who have access to these data must fully understand that <a href="https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/sharing-data-and-resources.html" target="_blank"<Arctos is a shared system</a>, and must always consider the implications of working in a shared system.

Environment is set at login. Users whose account has changed will need to log out and back in to receive changes.

### User Access Roles

To see definitions and documentation about user access roles visit <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/Admin/user_roles.cfm" target="_blank">Manage Arctos > Roles/Permissions > Database Roles</a>

## Maintenance and Deletion

Once a user has an account and an agent name type of “login,” do not attempt to delete or alter the account or the login agent name. Additionally, do not revoke collection access roles from a former user. To revoke a user’s permissions, simply click the “lock account” link from manage users (not manage agents).

User accounts automatically lock after 6 months of inactivity. 

Users whose accounts have been locked will not be able to log into Arctos, and must create a new (public) account if they wish to access Arctos.

Users who have their account locked and are subsequently re-granted access must use their original account. Operators with global_admin access may unlock accounts from the “manage Arctos user” page.

### Unlocking

Accounts are locked for a variety of reasons, including by automation.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**  

**Do Not** unlock an account unless you are fully aware of the circumstances under which it was locked and are, or are in communication with, the "supervisor" of all collections to which the user has access. Assume all unlock requests are [phishing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) until proven otherwise.

**_DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CREATE A NEW OPERATOR ACCOUNT FOR USERS WHO HAVE EVER HAD AN OPERATOR ACCOUNT IN ARCTOS!_**

All users should participate in the development process at GitHub; instructions are at [https://doi.org/10.7299/X75B02M5](https://doi.org/10.7299/X75B02M5)

Users should have a valid email address in their Agent record; without, they will not receive proper notifications for proposed agent mergers, transaction events, etc.

Collection Contacts are users who receive administrative emails when certain actions occur. Values are controlled by a code table. Users with Manage Collection access may manage Collection Contacts from Manage Collection <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/Admin/Collection.cfm" target="_blank">Manage Data –> Metadata –> Manage Collection</a>. Agents who act as collection contacts must have a valid email address.
