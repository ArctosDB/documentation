# How To Manage Code Table Addition or Change Requests (for Code Table Administrators)

[Code Tables in Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm) are maintained by the Arctos Community. [Arctos Code Table Administrators](http://arctos.database.museum/agent.cfm?agent_id=21327088&agent_name=Arctos%20Code%20Table%20Administrators) are community members with code table access who are able to add, edit or delete code table terms. The process for requesting a new code table term or making a change to an existing term is as follows:

## Make a Code Table Request 
All community members, including Code Table Administrators should submit a [GitHub Code Table Request Issue](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=authority-request.md&title=) to request any change to any code table.

1. Complete all pertinent parts of the form. 
2. Tag the issue with an appropriate [Priority label](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Use-Issues-in-Arctos.html#guidance-on-assigning-labels). 
3. Add the issue to the [Code Table Management Project](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/projects/13#card-31628184). 
4. Add the “Needs Discussion” milestone. 
5. If possible, assign the issue to any Arctos community members you know may have an interest in the term. 
6. If there is no response to your request within 2 days, contact one of the [Arctos Code Table Administrators](http://arctos.database.museum/agent.cfm?agent_id=21327088&agent_name=Arctos%20Code%20Table%20Administrators) for assistance. 

## Community Discussion 
Code Table change requests should be discussed by the community members it may affect. Not all community members monitor GitHub regularly, so it is helpful to assign or mention community members who may have an interest in the topic. For example, a discussion about a change to parts that are used by both mammal and paleo collections should include at least one member from each community. The length of time required for community discussion will vary. Some changes may only take a day and some may linger for months. If the extended discussion of a code table change request you have submitted is hampering your ability to get work done, make sure that the Priority-Critical label is added to the issue. 

## Issue Summary 
Once the community discussion is complete, there should be a “Summary” post to the issue. This post should include:
1. All details required for a Code Table Administrator to complete the addition, edit or deletion as agreed upon in the community discussion. 
2. Inform the Code Table Managers with @ArctosDB/Code_Table_Administrators 
3. Change the milestone to “Needs Code Table Review” 

## Code Table Administrator/DBA Evaluation 
Two Code Table Administrators and a DBA will evaluate the Summary post. If they agree that the request is straightforward, does not create inconsistencies, and will not significantly impact data already in Arctos, they will demonstrate their agreement by adding a “Thumbs Up” to the Summary post.

### Code Table Change Approved by Code Table Administrators and DBA 
If two Code Table Administrators and the DBA agree that the request can be implemented, one of the Code Table Administrators will complete the following tasks: 
1. Complete the implementation of the code table change in Arctos. 
2. Remove the priority label. 
3. Remove the milestone 
4. Add the issue to the Arctos Communications Project if the change needs broad communication. 
5. Close the issue. 
6. Move the issue to the “Code Table Edit Complete” column of the Code Table Management Project. 

### Code Table Change Not Approved by Code Table Administrators and DBA 
If a Code Table Administrator or DBA believes further discussion is required, They will take the following steps: 
1. Add the issue to the “Code Table Admins Discussing” column of the Code Table Management Project for discussion at the next monthly Code Table Administrators meeting. 
2. Change the milestone to “Needs Discussion” 
3. If the issue is not already tagged as Priority-Critical or Priority-High, change the priority to Priority-High. 
4. If the issue is already tagged as Priority-Critical, check with the community member who made the original request to determine if there is a need for a special meeting of Code Table Administrators to resolve the issue. 
5. Code Table Administrators Review 
6. If a code table change request is not unanimously approved by two Code Table Administrators and a DBA, the issue will be discussed by The Code Table Administrators at their monthly meeting and either returned to the community for more discussion, conditionally approved, or rejected. 

### Returned for Discussion 
If returned to the community for discussion, it will fall on the original requestor to stimulate discussion and present a new Summary resolution.

### Conditional Approval 
Occasionally, an issue requires multiple rounds of discussion and a notification to the community prior to implementation as it may affect daily activities of many community members. An example of such an issue can be found in the [Nature of ID GitHub discussion](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/2170). If conditionally approved, it has been deemed that an announcement should be made to the community prior to implementation. In such instances, a member of the Code Table Administrator Team will perform the following: 
1. Add the Blocked: Needs Discussion label to the issue. 
2. Add the Priority-Critical label to the issue. 
3. Change the issue milestone to “Needs Discussion” 
4. Add the issue to the “Critical Issues” column of the [AWG Agenda Project](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/projects/6). 
5. Facilitate discussion of the request with the Arctos Working Group (AWG) at the next meeting. The AWG will either [approve the request](###Code-Table-Change-Approved-by-Code-Table-Administrators-and-DBA), [return the request to the community for further discussion](###Returned-for-Discussion), [reject the request](###Rejected), or require an announcement of the approval before implementation (see next steps if this is the result). 
6. Prepare an announcement that includes a link to the latest Summary post in the issue and a deadline for community comments that is before the next AWG meeting. Send it to the Arctos Communication Chair for distribution to the Arctos mailing list. 
7. Facilitate discussion of the request with the Arctos Working Group (AWG) at the next meeting. If there are no objections to implementation of the request, the AWG will [approve the request](###Code-Table-Change-Approved-by-Code-Table-Administrators-and-DBA). If there are unresolved objections to the request, the AWG will [return the request to the community for further discussion](###Returned-for-Discussion). 

### Rejected 
If rejected, a member of the Code Table Administrators will perform the following: 
1. Add the issue to the “Code Table Edit Rejected” column of the Code Table Management Project. 
2. Remove any milestone 
3. Add the Priority-Cancelled label and remove any other Priority labels. 
4. Close the issue. 

## General Values Considerations 

1. Be consistent in terminology. Consistency is of the utmost importance, and when there is a conflict consistency should over-ride all
other considerations. For example, part "whole organism (partial)" exists for consistency; even though "whole" and "partial" in the 
same part name is somewhat nonsensical, this format preserves sort order (making choosing the correct part easier for 
data entry personnel) and provides predictable terminology for users.

2. Put the important stuff first. As of this writing there are about 800 parts; having all of the "whole organisms" together 
(with modifiers and preservation information being parenthetical or comma-separated) makes the data much more usable than having 
"partial organism" which might end up hundreds of rows away from similar material in a sorted list.

3. Be consistent at scale. Arctos has no inherent boundaries, and many collections 
(Host of parasite, Teaching, Hildebrandt anatomical preparations, or "cultural collections") do not follow taxonomic boundaries. 
Terminology and accompanying definitions must not be limited to certain material; "adult" (an age class) must be consistent across
bird, mammal, insect, and archeology collections, for example.

4. If you must provide discipline- or taxon-specific information, do so parenthetically. For example, age class "adult" is currently:
>Sexually mature. Mammals: all adult teeth in wear; all epiphyses solidly fused; surface of bones with no sponginess; sutures fused. 
>Birds: all bone surfaces well formed and hard surfaced; adult sized for the species.
>Cestodes: use mature/immature.


5. Follow Standards when possible; use or build on the work of others. (This is almost never possible in practice.) 

6. Consider user's needs. If a significant portion of users might want to find (and borrow) "skulls" then creating a separate part "skull"
and using it even when the skull is stored with the postcranial skeleton may be advantageous. If that is not the case, cataloging
"skeleton" rather than separate parts will result in 50% fewer parts and make the authority list easier to digest.
 
7. Consider doing nothing. Obscure terms which may only be used by a few specimens may be better stored as more general data
with explanatory remarks. This will need evaluated on a case by case basis.

8. Be explicit in terminology. Never abbreviate or make assumptions. "Sex=M" may make perfect sense to a mammalogist working
 in a mammal collection, but at the scope of Arctos "M" could refer to "monecious."
 
9. Be explicit in definitions. Make no assumptions; ensure that all terms are well-defined and make sense in any context.
Definitions should be given as complete sentences.

10. Ensure that definitions are functional. HOW is {thing} measured, _e. g._, for what purposes are these data suitable? Include links (preferably via the DOI system) to publications if possible.

11. Use mutually-exclusive terminology. Users (especially Operators) should never have an arbitrary choice.

12. Do not include both "thing (modifier)" and "thing" in the code table. Avoid creating new "bare" terms ("thing") in order
to avoid this problem in the future. Parts of unknown preservation/preparation should be explicit: "thing (unknown)."

13. Do no use unnecessary characters in authority values, particularly Attributes. Letters, dash, and space are generally acceptable. 

14. Include the GitHub discussion link/URL in the definition. For code tables without a special container for links, separate links from the definition and from each other with spaced pipes. Example: ``Some definition bla bla bla very descriptive. | https://www.google.com/ | https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/7202 `` Note that copying from the Issue may not work as intended; ensure links are bare URLs. Avoid using pipes in other ways.


## Specific Values Considerations

### Attribute Types (ctattribute_type)

Attribute types should only be added when they are clearly disambiguated from any existing type. Attributes should NOT include any method (including 'left', 'right', 'with claw', 'from notch', etc.) either in the term itself or in the description other than to say "add left or right in method" or something similar.

### Identifier Types (ctcoll_other_id_type)

Other identfier types should generally not be added.


### Media Relationships

If terms are added to or deleted from the [Media: Relationship Types](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctmedia_relationship), please alert the DBA as changes may be required to the Media Metadata Bulkload Tool.

### Part Names (ctspecimen_part_name)

2023-10-05 [Arctos Code Table Administrators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZ_S8VTp-m5Wrbb6cAK96ODPZpt2-Hvnvt6yfU9qVwg/edit#heading=h.jl6w6q271wt) meeting: All requests should be approved.

~~Part names should only be added when they are clearly disambiguated from any existing part. Part names should describe WHAT an object is, not how it is prepared or preserved. Part names should NOT include any preservation (use the [part preservation attribute](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctspecpart_attribute_type#preservation)), or modifier (use the [part modifier attribute](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctspecpart_attribute_type#part_modifier)) information either in the term itself or in the description other than to say "add preservation or part modifiers using part attributes" or something similar. Part names should be singular and should not be compounded using comma-separated lists.~~

### Taxon Terms

If terms are added to or deleted from the [Taxonomy: Term Values code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=cttaxon_term), please alert the DBA as changes may be required to the Classification Bulkload Tool.

### Informal Lithostratigraphy

The term should be comprised of sufficient formal "parentage" to be unambiguous, eg ``Blacks Fork Member unit A`` and start with the "formal" lithostratigraphy then follow with the "informal" in lowercase (except for letter designations like "unit A". The definition should reference a "type publication" (however informal). See [Issue 9674](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/6747) for additional background.
