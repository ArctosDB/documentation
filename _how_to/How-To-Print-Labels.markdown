# How to Print Labels

**Print specimen/object labels by querying the desired records and using the Manage Menu to "Print Any Report." From there, select the relevant report template to generate a PDF.**

* From the Search Page, query the specimen(s) that wish to print labels for. Search by catalog number, a series of catalog numbers, by accession number, or any parameters needed to return the intended records.

* On the Results page, navigate to the Manage Menu --> Print Any Report.
