# How To Bulkload Agents

Please keep in mind that Agents are shared across all Arctos collections. Read the [Agent Documentation](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/agent.html) before proceeding. 

## Check to see if Agents Exist in Arctos

Create a list of people included in the data to be migrated in a .csv file (Excel will work fine for this). Look in fields where you store the names of collectors, preparators, donors, publication authors, etc. The column header should be "preferred_name".

Review the list for alternate spellings and versions of "unknown" (names that are only initials or include only initials plus last name). Try to make each name as complete as possible and to ensure that there are no duplicates. Don't lose the original spellings/abbreviations as you will need to ensure they are either part of an Agent or are modified in your data to match an Agent name before you load your data.

An example of what a completed CSV would look like:

### Use the Agent Deconcatenator

This tool will attemp to separate multi-agent strings ("Jim Smith and John Doe") into individual Agents.


### Use the Agent Namestring Formatter

This tool will format names into "first middle last" and provide information about whether an Agent name appears proper, may have invalid characters, or be missing information and requires a CSV with a single column header of **preferred_names**. To access this tool, from the Arctos main menu select **Reports/Services > Data Services > Agent Namestring Formatter** 

Use the preferred_name file created above to upload to this tool. Selecting "Upload This File" will provide results that include three colums:

orig: the name in your original list  
manipulated: the "first middle last" format generated by Arctos  
comment: remarks about the name indicating that you may need to correct it in order to have a valid agent name

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Agent%20Namestring%20Formatter%20Results.JPG)

To download the results, select "get CSV" at the top of the results page. The manipulated names can be corrrected as necessary and used in the Agent bulkload tool.

**Comment Help** 

Comments can be cryptic, they may mean the following:

 * spaces - There are more than two spaces in the name as would be expected from a "first middle last" configuration. This may be correct such as in the case of "Jr." or "III" and can be ignored, but they should be reviewed to ensure that they are what is expected. 
 * weirdchars - There may be non-printing characters in the name, if so a version of the name without them should be created and added to the Agent record as an aka. This may also indicate that non-alphabetic but printable characters are present, "-" is one of the most common. This does not require a change to the name, but they should be reviewed to ensure that they are what is expected. 

### Use the Agent Name Splitter

This tool will help build the file needed for the Agent Bulkload Tool and requires a CSV with a single column header of **preferred_names**. Create the CSV for this tool using the cleaned names from the **Agent Namestrin Formatter** results as the values for **preferred_names**. To access this tool, from the Arctos main menu select **Reports/Services > Data Services > Agent Name Splitter**

Select your file, then "Upload This File"

The process may take a while. When it is complete, you will see a list of the names on your screen. Scroll to the bottom and follow the "move on" link

This will run the agent checker function, and it will ALWAYS fail - agent type is not provided to this application in the interest of simplicity. Scroll to the bottom of the data table that is generated and select **Download**

<img width="100%" alt="screen shot 2018-04-26 at 8 56 50 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5720791/39317159-c8c3f926-492f-11e8-8a13-3cb8096b3759.png">

The downloaded results can be used to correct names and remove names that are already in Arctos. The **Agent Name Splitter** injects a "formatted name." You may wish to replace preferred_name with this standardization. If the preferred names were already formatted according to the [Guidelines](/documentation/agent.html#creating--maintaining-agents), there is nothing of value in "formatted name," and both the Other_Name_1 and Other_Name_Type_1 columns can be deleted.

The {Agent Bulkload Tool Home page](http://arctos.database.museum/DataServices/agents.cfm) provides a list of required and optional columns. The agent_type must be added to the results of the **Agent Name Splitter** and should all be "person" if the **Agent Name Splitter** was successfully used.

This is a good time to delete full duplicates as well; these agents exist.

### Use the Bulkload Agents Tool

This tool is most often used as part of data migration by incoming collections but it may also be useful when a group of new Agents needs to be entered for other reasons such as members of an expedition or group of students working on a project. 

#### Prepare a Bulkload File

The Agent Bulkload tool requires a CSV file with the following column headers:

 * agent_type: items entered in this column fall under a controlled vocabulary which can be found at	[CTAGENT_TYPE](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTAGENT_TYPE)  
 * preferred_name: items entered in this column should be the full name of the Agents you wish to add. **NOTE** It is best to enter the most complete version of a person or organization's name here. (i.e. John Boy Jones, City Park Service, Jane G. Jones, etc.) This information can be taken from the "manipulated" column of the **Agent Namestring Formatter** results.
 
The Agent Bulkload tool will also accept alternate names for the same Agent in optional column headers:

 * other_name_n: items entered in this column may be part of an Agent's name, an alternate spelling of the Agent's name, or an alternate name for the same Agent.  
 * other_name_type_n: **REQUIRED if other_name_n is given** items entered in this column describe the alternate name given in **other_name_n** and are controlled by vocabulary which can be found at [CTAGENT_NAME_TYPE](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTAGENT_NAME_TYPE)   
 * agent_status_n: items entered in this column provide information about the life status of an Agent and are controlled by vocabulary found at [CTAGENT_STATUS](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTAGENT_STATUS)  
 * agent_status_date_n: **REQUIRED if agent_Status_n is given**	items in this column are dates that correspond to the life status given in **agent_status_n** and must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD  
 * agent_remark: items in this column might include a one sentence description of the agent or anything that might helpful to other users in understanding who or what the agent is **Never use remarks for data which can be linked or formalized elsewhere** 

  **NOTE** The "n" in the column headers above should be replaced with a number so that there may be multiple alternate names and associated name types added for a given Agent (up to 6 other_name_n and associated other_name_type_n, up to 2 agent_status_n and related agent_stats_date_n)

If you have not prepared a CSV file for this tool, it is easy to start one by downloading a template. To get the template, just select **get CSV template** at the top of the data fields list on the Bulkload Agents Tool page.

You will probably see an error message with an explanation. (Short version: Duplicate agents cause huge problems with data reliability; a little work now is MUCH easier than any alternative.)

An active member of the Arctos Working group (=has manage_codetables access) needs to review any errors and then may load these. The review process should include conformation that all information is being provided - e.g., that "J. S. Smith" is in these data because that's absolutely all we know, NOT because tradition mandates entering "John Smithson Smith" as initials only.

Someone with admin access will see a scary red box with an override link.

Click it, if there are no remaining errors the data should load.

To access the Bulkload Agents tool, from the Arctos main menu select **Enter Data > Batch Tools > Bulkload Agents**
