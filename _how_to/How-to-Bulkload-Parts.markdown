## [Bulkload Parts Template](#bulkload-parts-template)

If you do not have a Bulkload Parts Data sheet, begin with the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm?action=makeTemplate" class="external">Bulkload Parts Template</a>.

Definitions for fields in the template are found on the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm?action=ld" class="external">Bulkload Parts Tool Page</a>.

## Bulkload Parts File Preparation:

* Any header can be deleted, added, or rearranged in the excel sheet manually.

Be sure edited cells do not have an invisible lead or end these will cause your bulkload file to be rejected. 

DO NOT remove required field headers or your bulkload file will be rejected.

* The Part Bulkload Tool accepts one part associated with one catalog record identifier per row.

* The bulkloader allows for six part attributes per part. These are there only if you need them. You may or may not use them all and that is ok. They can be left blank. If you need to add more than six attributes, you may add them using the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadSpecimenPartAttribute.cfm" class="external">Part Attribute Bulkload Tool</a>. 

* Setting status to **autoload** will automatically load the part as long as no errors occur. If you would like to review parts be fore they load to catalog records, leave status blank. You can also enter anything other than **autoload** to group parts for review if that would be useful.

## Bulkload Parts 

On the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm?action=ld" class="external">Upload csv page of the Bulkload Parts Tool</a> select the Browse button and navigate to your file. Select open and then Upload this file. If you set status to **autoload** the parts will load automatically, but this may not be an instantaneous process, especially if you have loaded a lot of parts. You can always see the prgress of your part bulkload by visiting the Review and Load page of the Bulkload Parts Tool.

### Bulkload Status

Once you have loaded your parts, they will appear in the tool with a status that reflects their ability to be processed.

**autoload** indicates that they are in the queue for loading
**loaded** indicates they ahve been loaded and they can be deleted from the tool if you are satisfied with the outcome

All other statuses either indicate grouping created by you in your bulkload file or errors generated by Arctos when attempting to load. If edits need to be made to any items in the tool, you can download from the tool using one of the **get csv** options, make edits to the download and reload the corrected parts.

After you download, you may want to remove the downloaded records from the tool so that you don't create confusion with duplicate parts in the tool. To do this use one of the **Delete** options.
