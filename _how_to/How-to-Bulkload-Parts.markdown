# How to Bulkload Parts

From the Arctos main menu select **<a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm" class="external">Enter Data > Bulkload Tools > Parts > Bulkload Parts</a>**

## Bulkload Parts Template

If you do not have a Bulkload Parts data sheet, begin with the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm?action=makeTemplate" class="external">Bulkload Parts Template</a>.

Information about the fields in the template can be found on the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm?action=ld" class="external">Bulkload Parts Tool Page</a>.

## Bulkload Parts File Preparation

Any header in the template can be deleted, added, or rearranged.

* Be sure edited headers do not have an invisible lead or end as these will cause your bulkload file to be rejected. 

* **DO NOT** remove required field headers or your bulkload file will be rejected.

* The Part Bulkload Tool accepts one part associated with one catalog record identifier per row.

* The bulkloader allows for six part attributes per part. These are there only if you need them. They can be left blank or removed from the file if you do not need them. If you need to add more than six attributes for any given part, you may add them using the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadSpecimenPartAttribute.cfm" class="external">Part Attribute Bulkload Tool</a> after the part is loaded. 

* Setting status to **autoload** in your bulkload file will automatically load the part as long as no errors occur. If you would like to review parts before they load to catalog records, leave status blank or enter anything other than **autoload** to group parts for review if that would be useful. 

## Bulkload Parts 

On the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm?action=ld" class="external">Upload csv page of the Bulkload Parts Tool</a> select the **Browse** button and navigate to your file. Select open and then **Upload this file**. If you set status to **autoload** in your bulkload file the parts will load automatically, but this may not be an instantaneous process especially if you have loaded a lot of parts. You can always see the progress of your part bulkload by visiting the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadParts.cfm" class="external">Review and Load page of the Bulkload Parts Tool</a>. 

### Bulkload Status

Once you have loaded your parts, they will appear in the tool with a status that reflects their ability to be processed. 

* **autoload** indicates that parts are in the queue for loading 
* **loaded** indicates parts have been loaded and they can be deleted from the tool if you are satisfied with the outcome 

All other statuses either indicate grouping created by you in your bulkload file or errors generated by Arctos when attempting to load. If anything other than **autoload** is in the status field, the parts will not be loaded to the catalog records and they will remain in the Part Bulkload Tool until you either set them to **autoload** or delete them. Status for a given part or a group of parts can be changed using one of the **review** functions. 

If edits for anything other than status need to be made to any items in the tool, you can download from the tool using one of the **get csv** options, make edits to the downloaded file and reload the corrected parts.

After you download, you may want to remove the downloaded records from the tool so that you don't create confusion with duplicate parts in the tool. To do this use one of the **delete** options.
