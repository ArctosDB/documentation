  2. Get flat table containing label data from Arctos. 
  3. Run label data through label-generating R script. 
  4. Print the labels, check them, and label the specimens. 
  5. Create the containers in Arctos. 
  6. Move the specimens to the containers in Arctos via the automatically-generated bulkloading file.  Scan the pins into their parent contaiers, etc.
