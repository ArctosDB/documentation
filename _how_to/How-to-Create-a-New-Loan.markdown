# How to Create a New Loan

Before initiating a loan you must ensure that the recipient of the loan is an Agent within Arctos.  If they are not already an Agent (use Manage Data > Agents to search for them in the Agents database) then you will need to create an Agent for them.

### Initiating a Loan

To initiate the loan, use the Arctos drop-down menus to select **Manage Data > Transactions > Create Loan**

The following fields will be visible on the Initiate a Loan page:

* **Collection**- Here you will indicate the collection from which specimens will be loaned. Select this from the drop-down menu.

* **Loan Number** - Here you will assign a unique identifier to the loan. On the right side of the screen there should be a box titled “Next Available Loan Number” that provides a list of loan identifiers by collection. To populate the Loan Number field, click on the identifier that corresponds to the relevant collection. The result should be an identifier in the following format: year..collection (e.g., 2016..Mamm). To complete the Loan Number you will need to enter an appropriate value between the two periods (year.#.collection).  For example, the first loan of 2016 from the mammal collection would be denoted 2016.1.Mamm.

* **Authorized By** - Indicate the Agent name for the curator or other individual who is responsible for authorizing the loan.

* **To** - Indicate the Agent name of the recipient of the loan.  

* **In-House Contact** - This field will automatically populate with the same name identified in “Authorized By” after the loan is created.  Alternatively, a different contact (e.g., collection manager) could be identified.

* **Outside Contact** - This field will automatically population with the same name identified in “To” after the loan is created. Alternatively, a different contact (e.g., collection manager) could be identified.

* **Loan Type** - Indicate the nature loan. For information on selection of loan type, see [Best Practice - Selecting a Loan Type](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/blob/gh-pages/_best_practices/Loan_Type.markdown).

* **Loan Status** - Here you will indicate the current status of the loan.  

   - In process: This is appropriate after you initiate the loan, but before you ship it.

   - Open: This is the appropriate status for the period during which the loan is still out.

   - Closed: It is appropriate to close the loan after all specimens are returned and re-installed in your collection.

* **Transaction Date** - This field should automatically populate with the date on which the loan was initiated.

* **Return Due Date** - Click the box and a mini-calendar will drop down. Select the date by which the loan should be returned.

* **Nature of Material** - Provide a description of the loan material: how many specimens, what will be done with them, where they are going, etc. This is also a good place to enter the catalog numbers of the specimens being loaned.

Once all of these fields are completed, click the “Create Loan” button at the bottom of the page.

A new page will pop up in which you can edit the loan to provide specific information about projects associated with the loan.

### Adding Specimens to the Loan

After you create the loan and the edit page pops up, click the “Add Items” link found at the bottom of the "Edit Loan" box in the menu just below the “Save Edits” button.

The standard specimen search page will appear, but with red letters saying:  **You are searching for items to add to a loan**

Search for specimens as you normally would. When Arctos finds your searched specimens, there will be an option next to each specimen’s parts that will allow you to add it to the loan. Select the relevant specimens/parts and then click “Back to Loan” at the top of the page (above the line that indicates the number of specimens that were found).
