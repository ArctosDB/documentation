## How To Create a New Specific Locality

Most locality tasks consists of editing localities that have been previously created. Occasionally, however, you will need to create a new locality, whether to assign new events or to clean up messy data. Fortunately, the process is straightforward.

* After logging in, go to the menubar tab 'Manage Data'. Under Location, click on “Create Locality” button. The Create Locality page has only six entries and a Save button.

* To begin with: the higher geography of the new locality can be selected by searching on the higher geography for an established locality. You can type directly into all of the other fields, then click “Save” to move on.

* Clicking “Save” will bring us back to a familiar page. After creating the new locality, you will be redirected to its Edit Locality page so that you can make additional changes. Further useful changes to localities are outlined in the How To pages. 

TIP: be sure to make a note of your new Locality ID number given at the top of the page.
