## Create Attributes

* Select the desired "Attribute" from the "Create New Attribute" drop-down menu (note: menu values are unique to collection type). Additional fields will appear in the attribute table depending on the attribute type selected (e.g., Value, Units).
* Fill in required data (yellow-highlighted fields) and any additional pertinent information in the fields provided.
* Click the "Save All" button below the table to create the attribute. Upon saving, a new blank row will appear so that additional attributes can be added. **TIP:** Use the "use Agent1/Date1" hypertext to carry over agent name and determination date when creating new attributes.
* Continue creating new attributes as desired by populating the appropriate fields and saving.
