## Add Parts to a catalog record

Use the blue "Add Specimen Part" box at the bottom of the screen to create new specimen parts:
* Begin to type desired part name in the Parts field and click "TAB". A pop-up menu will appear with value options. Click on the appropriate part name. **TIP:** Click on the "Define Values" hypertext in the Part field above to view a full listing of value options.
* Indicate the number of parts/specimens in the **Count** field.
* Select **Disposition** from the drop-down menu.
* Describe specimen **Condition** (e.g., "good," "tail broken," "dissected")
* Record any pertinent **Remarks**.
* Click the "Create" button. The new part will appear in the Parts Table above. Barcodes can now be added to track where parts are located (see [How to Create and Edit Containers](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Create-and-Edit-Containers) for more details).

## EDIT Parts in a catalog record
* Edit any existing information saved in the Parts fields and click the "Save All Changes" button at the bottom of the table to commit edits.
* Scan or type in the relevant barcode to place a Part in an existing Container (see [How to Create and Edit Containers](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Create-and-Edit-Containers.html) for more details). After saving, the container location can be confirmed by clicking on the Part Location Tab.

## DELETE Parts from a catalog record

* Delete any attributes associated with the part to be deleted. Parts that have an associated part attribute, such as preservation cannot be deleted without first removing the attribute(s).
