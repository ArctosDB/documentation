(Based on a guide initally developed by April Payne, Northern Michigan University)

* Search for the catalog record you wish to edit and select the record from the search results.

* Click the “Other IDs” tab from the list of options above the catalog record information boxes.

* You can assign a catalog number in the appropriate field of the resulting window.

   * To identify breaks in assigned catalog numbers, click the “[find gaps]” link to the right of the catalog number field.

* When finished, click “Save Changes”. The change will be saved and can be viewed when you run a new search for the catalog record. If you try to refresh the page Arctos will give you an error message because the catalog number has changed.
