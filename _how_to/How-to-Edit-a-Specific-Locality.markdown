### Find the Locality to Edit

**From Specimen Search**

* Search for the specimen and click on its GUID to go to the specimen detail page.

* In the Locality section of the detail page, click on "Edit" in the upper right corner. Alternatively, go to the Locality tab above the specimen data on the detail page.

* Click "Edit Locality" on the right side of the window.

**From Locality Search**

* Go to Manage Data > Location > Find Locality.

* Enter your search term(s) to find the Specific Locality.

* In the Locality column, click on "Edit [Locality_ID]" to change that Specific Locality.

## _Understand what's being edited_

At the top of the edit locality page, you should see a red box with a summary of what's using the locality (specimens and media). 
Any edits will affect ALL of those things. If that is not intended, STOP and find a different pathway.
[/how_to/How-to-Reassign-Specimens-to-Another-Locality.html](/how_to/How-to-Reassign-Specimens-to-Another-Locality.html) may be useful.


### Change the Higher Geography

Higher Geography is used to describe the larger geography (county level and above) under which a Specific Locality falls. To change the Higher Geography for a Specific Locality (and all records tied to that Locality_ID), in the Edit Locality window:

* Click on the gray-green “Change for this Locality” button under "Higher Geography" to open up a new window.

* Type in a search term and click “Find Matches” to bring up a list of results. It is helpful to search for the most specific geographic level you can (e.g., state or county).

* Select the appropriate entry will automatically enter it into the field on the Edit Locality page.

* Click "Save Edits" at the bottom of the screen.

### Edit the Specific Locality

* Edits to the Specific Locality may include the locality description, elevation, remarks, and/or coordinates and their metadata. All of those fields comprise the Specific Locality.

* Elevation includes minimum and maximum elevation (often those are the same), as well as elevational units.

* Coordinates include Decimal Latitude and Decimal Longitude, Max Error with units, Datum, georeference_source (how the coordinates were determined), and Georeference Protocol.

* Locality Remarks provides information about any part of the locality that will aid in understanding the place. Feel free to be  descriptive with the Locality Remarks. If you had to look up a more detailed map, if you assumed a feature was misspelled, if you thought a town’s boundaries were some distance away from its center, if …………………… Make a note of it! This field is helpful for backtracking and fact-checking. A researcher down the line might not understand how a particular georeference was assigned, and an extra note on your part can validate your decision.
