# How To Enter Data for a Single Record 

### Documentation: [Catalog Record](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/catalog.html)

### Navigation: [Tools Directory > Data Entry -> Enter Records]([https://arctos.database.museum/enter_data.cfm](https://arctos.database.museum/Bulkloader/enter.cfm))

## Select a Data Entry Form 

### Begin with Previous Records 

You can start with the last record you entered or if you have sufficient access, with any previously entered record.

### Choose a Collection

Use this option to start from scratch, or from the values stored in a Profile. Select the collection for which you wish to enter data and you will start with your last data entry customization.

After choosing one of these options, you will be directed to the appropriate data entry form.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**

The background of your new data entry screen should be **green**. If it is not, Arctos will not let you save your data.

### Pick a Profile 

Profiles are customized data entry forms that may carry seed data. You - or any other user - may use any profile to begin data entry with the data and arrangement in the profile. To see existing profiles or create a new profile, select the **Customize** button at the bottom of the data entry screen.

Once at the customization screen, you can select an existing profile with the **Profiles Home** button.

The Profile you are currently using will appear at the top of the list. You may create any number of Profiles, use Profiles created by others, and others may use Profiles created by you. 

 Profiles serve several functions:

 - control the number of some items (such as Attributes) on entry pages
 - hide some individual fields
 - control the post-save behavior by carrying or clearing values entered in the previous record
 - carry "seed" data, defaulted in when the entry form first loads

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**

Note that a Profile's seed data will NOT be loaded when a seed record is used. The Profile's customization will still be used. Also, data values saved in a Profile will have a distinct style and should be carefully checked before saving a record.

## How To Customize Data Entry and Create Profiles

See [How To Customize the Data Entry Form](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/customize_data_entry.html)

## Data Entry Form Details

The following provides some specifics by data entry section.

### Catalog Record Data

This block includes data about the entire catalog record.

**REQUIRED**

* **accn** is the acquisition number that is given to a set of objects, e.g., 01.2014 and can be selected using the **pick** button. The accession **does not** need to be associated with the same collection as the item being entered.

* **guid_prefix** will be completed based upon the collection selected above or what has been added to a Profile if one is selected and includes this information.

* **record_type** can be left blank if you wish to use the default type selected in collection metadata (See [How To Manage a Collection](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Manage-a-Collection-in-Arctos.html#default-cataloged-item-type)).

**OPTIONAL**

* **cat_num** can be left blank if you wish Arctos to assign the next available number (only for collections using integer catalog numbers).
  
* **flags** can be used to add a notification to the record that some data needs attention after the record is entered. Values are selected from a [code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctflags).

* **record_remark** is a free text field where anything related to the catalog record that does not fit in the other fields can be documented.

### Identifiers
This block includes any identifiers other than the catalog number that are applied to the objects or observations being cataloged or that are applied to objects or observations related to the object or observation being cataloged. You can add 5 identifiers to any catalog record in data entry. Additional identifiers can be added manually or via the [Identifier: Bulkload Tool](https://arctos.database.museum/loaders/BulkloadOtherId.cfm).

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**

Any information entered will be ignored unless identifier_type is completed.

**CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** (if any other identifier information is entered)

* **identifier_type** is selected from a [code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcoll_other_id_type)

**OPTIONAL** 

* **identifier_issued_by** can be left blank, but should be completed with the preferred name of the Arctos Agent that issued the identifier if known. If the Agent does not exist, leave blank and place the information in identifer_remark.
  
* **identifier_value** is the **COMPLETE** identifer. When the identifier is a webpage, DOI, or some other resolvable identifier enter the full url.

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Pro.jpg) **Pro Tip**

Arctos includes a helpful tool to help build complete urls for a host of known identifiers. If all you have is the identifier, but you believe it may be part os a url, use the **build** button at the far right of the identifier row to make use of the tool.

* **identifier_relationship** documents how the identifier_value is related to the catalog record being entered. Default is self (the identifier is applied to the object or observation being cataloged). Values are selected from a [code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctid_references).

* **identifier_remark** is a free-text field that allows you to make comments about the identifier.

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Pro.jpg) **Pro Tip**

Has the data for the record already been entered as part of another record? You can enter the identifier_issued_by, identifier_type and identifier_value and use the **pull** button on the same row to fill in the current record with data from that record. 

### Identification 

This block includes data about what identifications are applied to the catalog record. You can add 2 identifiations to any catalog record in data entry. Additional identifications will need to be added manually or via the [Identification Bulkload Tool](https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadIdentification.cfm).

**CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** (if an identification_n is supplied)

* **identification_n_order** indicates the "acceptedness" of the identification. "0" = unaccepted, "1" = most accepted, "2"-"10" = accepted, but less so than anything with order = "1".

**OPTIONAL**

* **identification_n** is the identification to be applied to the cataloged item. Type in all or part of the cataloged item’s identification and use the Tab key to select a taxon name, or use the **build** button to create a complex identification.

* **identification_n_date** is the date the identification was assigned. If this is not known, leave it blank.

* **identification_n_remark** can be used to add information about the identification, including a verbatim determiner(s) if the Identifying Agent(s) are not found in Arctos Agents.

* **identification_n_agent_n** is the Arctos Agent that determined the identification. Type in all or part of the Agent’s name and use the Tab key to select an Agent. Up to 3 determiners can be added in data entry. Additional determiners will need to be added manually.

#### Identification Attributes

Every identification can include up to 3 attributes in data entry, additional identification attributes can be added manually.

**CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** (if any other identification attribute information is entered)

* **Attribute** is selected from a [code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm).

* **Value** may be selected from a code table, be a number, or accept free text depending upon the attribute selected.

**OPTIONAL**

* **Units** are **CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** by some attribute types, otherwise should be left blank.
 
* **Date** is the date the attribute was determined.

* **Determiner** is the Arctos Agent that determined the attribute value. Type in all or part of the Agent’s name and use the Tab key to select an Agent.

* **Method** is a free-text description of how the determination was made.

* **Remark** can be used to add information about the identification attribute, including verbatim determiner(s) if the determining Agent(s) are not found in Arctos Agents.

### Agents

This block includes data about people or organizations that performed one of the [agent roles](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollector_role) with regard to the catalog record. You can add 8 Agents to any catalog record in data entry. Additional Agents can be added manually or via the [Agent Role: Bulkload Tool](https://arctos.database.museum/loaders/BulkloadCollector.cfm).

**CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** (both **agent_n_role** and **agent_n_name** must be completed or the information will be ignored)

* **agent_n_role** is selected from a [code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollector_role).
 
* **agent_n_name** is the Arctos Agent that performed the selected role. Type in all or part of the Agent’s name and use the Tab key to select an Agent.

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Pro.jpg) **Pro Tip**

Use the **CopyAcross** button next to any Agent to add the name to all other agent fields in the form.

### Place and Time

This block consists of three sections: Record Event, Event, and Locality.

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**

**NONE** of the information entered in these sections will save if **record_event_type** is blank.

#### Record-Event

This block includes data about why the **Event** has been associated with the cataloged objects or observations. The information here indicates curation and the activities are related to documenting who and why an Event is associated with the cataloged objects or observations. You can add 1 Record-Event to any catalog record in data entry. Additional Record-Events can be added manually or via the [Catalog Record Event: Bulkload Tool](https://arctos.database.museum/loaders/BulkloadSpecimenEvent.cfm).

**CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** (if ANY portion of the Time and Place section includes information)

If the geography you have is not in the code table, you can use [no specific higher geography](https://arctos.database.museum/place.cfm?action=detail&geog_auth_rec_id=10016350) or if you have no information on geography use [no higher geography recorded](https://arctos.database.museum/place.cfm?action=detail&geog_auth_rec_id=69). See also [Higher Geography Documentation](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/higher-geography.html)

* **locality_specific** should hold all the location information that would allow someone to find the place on a map or by verbal directions. This value should **exclude** anything placed in any of the other fields available in **Locality**

**OPTIONAL**

* **locality_name** Localities can be created in advance, given names, and used to eliminate the need for entering the same data into multiple catalog records.
 
![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Caution.jpg) **Caution**

Entering an exisiting **Locality** name here will ignore any data that you enter in any of the remaining **Locality** fields.

Use the **pull/sync locality** button to view the data that is included in the **Locality**. If you find that you have chosen the wrong **locality** name, then you can use the **clear all locality** button to remove any **Locality** data and start over.
