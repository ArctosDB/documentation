# How to Link Genetic Data To And From Arctos


## Method 1: Single-specimen

1. Find the specimen
2. Click Other IDs
3. Select appropriate identifier type; enter identifier 
4. Save

## Method 2: Batch

1. Navigate to Enter/Batch/Identifiers
2. Download the template
3. Fill in required information
4. Upload, follow the prompts

The rest of the process is automated; no further action is required, and links will be maintained by Arctos staff.
Links to GenBank (et al.) are formed immediately, linkouts should appear from GenBank within 48 hours. 


# Important Notes

1. "Appropriate identifier type" is usually "GenBank," but Arctos supports interaction with other types of genetic data, such as
	  [NCBI Sequence Read Archive Run ID](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). 
	  See the [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTCOLL_OTHER_ID_TYPE) for more information.
	  
2. Arctos constantly monitors GenBank, and will report potential uncited specimens under Reports/genbankMIA. 
	We recommend working with the submittor to ensure that these records are properly submitted to GenBank 
	(e.g., they should all link to Arctos from /specimen_voucher) and to the appropriate Arctos Curators.
