# How To Merge Duplicate Localities

If you notice that there are many localities that have the same specific locality and the same coordinates you will want to merge them into one.

* From Arctos, go to Manage Data > Location > Find Locality

* Input the criteria you want to find your locality, such as Specific Locality, Locality ID, etc., and click "Search"

<s>* Under one of the localities you want to merge, click "check for duplicates"

* Scroll down until you see the "merge checked localities with this locality" button.

* Check the ones you want merged (which is typically all of them unless you have some specific reason not to) and click "merge checked localities with this locality"</s>
