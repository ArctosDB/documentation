# How To Request TACC Access to Media Storage

The [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) offers media hosting for Arctos users through an Arctos Project allocation. If you are using TACC to store media, you must first request access to the secure TACC storage. 

To request access and an institution specific directory on TACC, create a special [Github Issue called *Arctos Digital Media Storage Request*](https://github.com/ArctosDB/internal/issues/new/choose). The steps are listed below for reference.
