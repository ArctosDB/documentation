# How To Search Agents

#### Navigation: [Search > Agents](https://arctos.database.museum/agent.cfm)

Search Agents to explore how people and organizations support collections, connect with each other, and much more.

## Agent Name

Enter the name of the person or organization you want to find in Arctos.

 - At least three characters are required to search.
 - A generic search, such as only a last name is preferred. This form is searching Agent Preferred Names, so a search for John Smith will not return the agent John H. Smith, but a search for Smith will return both.
