# How To Search Agents

**Documentation:** <a href="https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/agent.html" target="_blank">Agents</a>

## Public Search

The search form for those who do not have manage_agents authority.

#### Navigation: [Search > Agents](https://arctos.database.museum/agent.cfm)

Search Agents to explore how people and organizations support collections, connect with each other, and much more. 

### Agent Name

Enter the name of the person or organization you want to find in Arctos.

 - At least three characters are required to search.
 - A generic search, such as only a last name is preferred. This form is searching Agent Preferred Names, so a search for John Smith will not return the agent John H. Smith, but a search for Smith will return both.
 
## Arctos Agent Manager Search

The search form for those who have manage_agents authority contains several fields and options, detailed below. All are case-insensitive substring matches. You may also include the special characters \_ and % to match any single character or any string, respectively. 

### Any name search

Any part of a name is appropriate for most exploratory searching. It matches any name, including preferred, AKAs, name
components, and login name.

### Agent Type

Agent Type matches values used in the [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTAGENT_TYPE).

### Agent ID

Agent ID matches the (internal, primary key) `agent_id` (an integer).

### Agent Name Type

Agent Name Type matches values used in a [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTAGENT_NAME_TYPE).

### Agent Name

Agent Name matches names of the chosen type.

### Address

Address matches any part of [any address](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTADDRESS_TYPE),
including mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses.

ORCiD and Wikidata urls are found in the addresses section of the agent table.

### Agent Status

Agent Status matches values from a [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTAGENT_STATUS). This may be combined with "**Match**" and **Status Date** to locate agents reported in an event, agents having an event on a date, or events happening on, before, or after a given date.

### Created By

Created By (and corresponding **match** types and **Created Date**) may be used to find agents created by an agent, agents created by an agent on/before/after a date, or agents created on/before/after a date.
