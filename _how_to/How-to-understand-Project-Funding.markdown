# How To Understand Project Funding

Arctos now provides a "funded_USD" field in Projects. (We leave it up to individuals to define what constitutes project funding.) These data may be used to illustrate the broader impacts of a project which contributes specimen that are subsequently used in other research projects. An example follows.

Under Edit Project, enter a numeric value for the funding of a project.

Edit a project which used specimens contributed by the original project to add a funding value.

The originating project's detail page will now summarize the value of projects which used specimens contributed by the original project.

Note that in this case the originating project is linked to accessions (contributions) and loans (usage), and so is included in the "broader impacts" funding calculations.
