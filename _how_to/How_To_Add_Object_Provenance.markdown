# How To Record Prior Inclusion in Another Collection

Objects have often passed through many hands before finally arriving in a museum collection and provenance information is valuable to historians and can also sometimes help to verify the veracity of a record.

When an object was once part of another collection this may be denoted with stamps, printed labels, or handwritten entries. In herbaria, specimens often have stamps related to exchange clubs.

## Recording Prior Collection Inclusion

Complete the following steps to record an object's previous inclusion in another collection.

 - [Search Agents](https://arctos.database.museum/agent.cfm) to see if the previous collection exists in Arctos. If it does not, create an agent of type [other agent](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctagent_type#other_agent) using the collection's name as preferred name. See [Flora of Manitoba](https://arctos.database.museum/agent/21339709) for an example.
 - Add the agent to the appropriate catalog record with the role [collector](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollector_role#collector).
