# How To Customize the Search Page 

The main search page can be customized for queries to reflect the preferred suite of fields displayed or used most frequently when searching. Customization options are saved to the user profile when logged in.


### Navigation: [Main Page OR Search -> Catalog Record](https://arctos.database.museum/search.cfm)

## Default Search

This is akin to a 'Basic' search. Here, the search form has a limited set of options visible.

## Show All Options

Use the menu within each category to display all fields available by selecting "show all options" from the drop-down menu. For example, when selecting this option for Identifiers, GUID and Any Identifier and an Identifier Type menu appear in addition to the three default fields (Collection, Catalog Number, and Relationship)

### Bullet Points
* add bullet points by placing `* ` at the beginning of a line
 
### Links to Another How To
Link to other How Tos by putting the link text in square brackets followed immediately by the page url in parenthesis [How To Find and Edit Loans](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Find-and-Edit-Loans.html)
`[How To Find and Edit Loans](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Find-and-Edit-Loans.html)`

This same technique can be used for any links you would like to add.

### Images

### Code Blocks
If you want to add some code that you want to be visible in the How To, place it between two lines of three backticks (the symbol under the tilde on most QUERTY keyboards).
```
This is a block and can include code
* see how the bullet point doesn't render?
> or the quote block?
```

Always include the two sections below! But change the link text and link urls to indicate the appropriate items. If there is no video tutorial, add the text "Video Tutorial Needed".

## Tutorial Videos ↗️
