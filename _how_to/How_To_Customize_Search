### Links to Another How To
Link to other How Tos by putting the link text in square brackets followed immediately by the page url in parenthesis [How To Find and Edit Loans](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Find-and-Edit-Loans.html)

This same technique can be used for any links you would like to add.

```
This is a block and can include code
