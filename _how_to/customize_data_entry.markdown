# How To Customize the Data Entry Form

**Documentation: [Catalog Record](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/catalog.html)**

The data entry form can be customized to reflect the preferred suite of fields displayed, pre-populated with field values, and to provide suggestions for term values. Customization options are saved to the user profile for the last record entered and will automatically display on subsequent logins if last record is selected. Cutomizations can also be saved as profiles and shared with others.

### Navigation: [Tools Directory > Data Entry > Enter Records](https://arctos.database.museum/Bulkloader/enter.cfm)

## Enter Catalog Records
Select any of the available options on this page to get to the data entry screen. Once you've selected a collection in some way, the form will load and you may customize or choose a Profile by selecting the **Customize** button in the footer of the data entry screen.

## Profile Metadata

### Profile Name
Create a name for your cusomized profile. It is recommended that the name include only lower-case letters. Please refrain from using profanity or hurtful language in profile names as these profiles will be subject to removal without notice. See the [Arctos Code of Conduct](https://arctosdb.org/code-of-conduct/).

### Description
Tell future-you (and other users) what this profile includes/does. It is recommendaed that you say something about the collection(s) for which this Profile is being created as well as the purpose of the customization.

`Profile for entry of Natural History Society of Maryland geology records.`

## Counts and Ordering

### _order
For each section of the data entry form you can set an order. This determines the placement of the data blocks on the form with 1 at the top. Default order is as follows:

1. Record
2. Identifiers
3. Identifications
4. Agents
5. Place & Time
6. Record Attributes
7. Parts

Your browser will do whatever it wants if order isn't unique!

### _count

For any section of data entry where multiple rows are allowed, you can select how many rows you want to appear on the data entry page.

You cannot increase the number of rows for any section while in the process of data entry and a return to customization will lose whatever data you have entered but not saved, so you may want to include extra rows just in case.

## Individual Field Behavior

Before proceeding to work in this section, it is recommended that you set and save the above by selecting the **Save and Return Here** button at the top right of the screen so that only your selected counts of multiple row items will be displayed. The default for this part of the form is "everything".

### Category
The data entry block in which the customized field resides.

### Field
The data entry field (corresponds to a bulkloader column header)

### Show
This field **will** be displayed on the data entry form

### Carry
This field **will** be displayed on the data entry form and value in the field will be carried to the next record entered

### Hide
This field **will not** be displayed on the data entry form

### DefaultValue
Data entered here will auto-populate in the data entry form

### Pulled 
This field will be populated with any information that has been pulled into the form using the **Pull values from form** button at the top right of the page.

Pulled values will not automatically save. Select **use** next to the values that you want to keep.

![](https://raw.Githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Pro.jpg) **Pro Tip**

If you want to keep all of the values, save time by selecting the **Use all values from form** button at the top right of the screen.

## Save Profile

When you have completed your customization, select the **Save and Use** button at the top right of the screen to begin using your customized data entry form.
