# Data Entry: The Big Picture


All record entry goes through a table named ``bulkloader``. There are several ways to write to this table, and any number of others are possible. The loader scripts may be set to load the record, or to load the record and trigger any UUID-linked records in 'component loaders' to also load.


## Current

### Arctos Entry Form

There is a generic record entry form provided as part of the Arctos UI.

### Record Bulkloader

## Possibilities

Various points of expansion have been discussed, or are available but not used.
