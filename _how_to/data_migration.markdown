# How To Migrate Data Into Arctos

This How To walks through the steps of data migration. These steps are more completely outlined in the numbered issue templates in the [Arctos Data Migration Github repository](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration).

## Manage Collection(s)

Before any data is entered, it is important that the collection metadata is complete.

Documentation: [Managing a Collection in Arctos](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/manage_collection.html)
Handbook instructions: [How To Manage a Collection](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Manage-a-Collection-in-Arctos.html) 

## Create Your Arctos Team

At least one person at any institution will have an operator account created as part of creation of the collection(s). Anyone else who will assist with data migration or data entry will need to follow the same steps to become an Arctos operator.

* Handbook instructions: [How To Create and Manage Your Arctos Team (Users and Operators)](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-your-Arctos-Team-Users-and-Operators.html) 

## Agents

People and organizations are associated with almost all types of data available in Arctos so it is important to map the names in use in your current data to names available in Arctos.

### Permissions
Agents are a shared resource in Arctos and care should always be given to editing existing agents and efforts made to not create duplicate agents. At least one person at every institution should have permission to [manage agents](https://arctos.database.museum/Admin/user_roles.cfm#manage_agents).

Read the documentation about Agents and How To Create Agents and respond in the appropriate Github issue that you understand that Agents are a shared resource in Arctos and you understand how to manage them. Once this is complete, you will be given permission to [manage agents](https://arctos.database.museum/Admin/user_roles.cfm#manage_agents).

### Links to Another How To
Link to other How Tos by putting the link text in square brackets followed immediately by the page url in parenthesis [How To Find and Edit Loans](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Find-and-Edit-Loans.html)
`[How To Find and Edit Loans](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Find-and-Edit-Loans.html)`

This same technique can be used for any links you would like to add.

### Code Blocks
If you want to add some code that you want to be visible in the How To, place it between two lines of three backticks (the symbol under the tilde on most QUERTY keyboards).
```
This is a block and can include code
* see how the bullet point doesn't render?
> or the quote block?
```

Always include the two sections below! But change the link text and link urls to indicate the appropriate items. If there is no video tutorial, add the text "Video Tutorial Needed".
