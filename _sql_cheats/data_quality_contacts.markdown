# List of Data Quality Contacts by Collection

This query provides a list of the collection(s) in Arctos and the email address of their active data quality contact (no email means no data quality contact).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/Bear%20Pro.jpg) **Pro Tip**  

For collections wanting to check their status and users, there's a report at <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/tools/access_report.cfm" target="_blank">Reports/Services > Labels and Reports > Database Roles</a>

All users will get a different answer. If you want a list of all collections, please coordinate with the Database Administrator.
